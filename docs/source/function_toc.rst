Function descriptions
==========

The following is a detailed description of some key functions in the Spotscope source code. The code can be broadly divided into two main sections: one for the dataset, which is primarily used to construct data objects, and the other for the functional functions, which implement the core features of Spotscope.

    Dataset Section: This part of the code is responsible for handling and organizing the input data. It is primarily focused on creating data objects that represent the underlying spatial transcriptomics data, facilitating the efficient storage and retrieval of relevant information.

    Functional Functions Section: The second section contains the functional functions, which are crucial for the core operations of Spotscope. These functions perform various tasks, such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model inference, all of which are essential for the accurate analysis and interpretation of spatial transcriptomics data.
