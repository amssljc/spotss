SpatialScope
=============================================

A unified approach for integrating spatial and single-cell transcriptomics data by leveraging deep generative models.

With the learned gene expressions distribution from scRNA-seq reference, SpatialScope can resolve the spot-level seq-based ST data (e.g., Visium) into single-cell resolution. Besides, it can also impute unmeasured genes or correct low-quality genes when applied to higher resolution ST data such as Slideseq and MERFISH. 
The inferred single-cell resolution transcriptome-wide expression levels can be applied to various downstream analysis, such as fine-grained cell gradients visualization, detection and visualization of spatially resolved cellular communication and identification of spatially DE genes.
